#   Linear Regression
# ============================================================================
#
#   * Linear regression models the relationship between input features and
#     a continuous target variable using a linear equation.
#
#   * Model performance is commonly evaluated using RMSE, which measures
#     prediction error, and R^2, which measures the proportion of variance
#     explained by the model.
#
#   * Comparing training and test performance helps identify underfitting
#     and overfitting, two common challenges in machine learning.
